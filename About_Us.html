            <br><br>The promotion was founded in 1953 as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Wrestling_Corporation" target="_blank" title="CWC">Capitol Wrestling Corporation</a> (CWC), a Northeastern territory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wrestling_Alliance" title="NWA" target="_blank">National Wrestling Alliance</a> (NWA). Following a dispute, CWC left the NWA and became the <b>World Wide Wrestling Federation</b> (WWWF) in April 1963. After rejoining the NWA in 1971, the WWWF was renamed to the <b>World Wrestling Federation</b> (WWF) in 1979 before the promotion left the NWA for good in 1983. In 2002, following a legal dispute with the <a target="_blank" title="World Wildlife Fund" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature">World Wildlife Fund</a>, the WWF was renamed to <b>World Wrestling Entertainment</b> (WWE). In 2011, the promotion ceased branding itself as World Wrestling Entertainment and began solely branding itself with the initials <b>WWE</b>.<sup>[9]</sup>
            
            <br><br>Prior to September 2023, the company's majority owner was its executive chairman, third-generation wrestling promoter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon" target="_blank" title="Vince Mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a>, who retained a 38.6% ownership of the company's outstanding stock and 81.1% of the voting power. The current entity, which was originally named <b>Titan Sports, Inc.</b>, was incorporated on February 21, 1980, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yarmouth,_Massachusetts" target="_blank" title="South Yarmouth">South Yarmouth, Massachusetts</a>, but reincorporated under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_General_Corporation_Law" target="_blank" title="General Corporation Law">General Corporation Law</a>  in 1987. It acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., the holding company for the WWF, in 1982. Titan was renamed <b>World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc.</b> in 1999, and then <b>World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.</b> in 2002. In 2023, its legal name was changed to <b>World Wrestling Entertainment, LLC.</b><sup>[10]</sup>

Its main roster is divided into two <a title="Brand Extension" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_brand_extension" target="_blank">brands</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_(WWE_brand)" target="_blank" title="Monday Night Raw">Raw</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmackDown_(WWE_brand)" title="SmackDown" target="_blank">SmackDown</a> , along with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team" title="Farm System" target="_blank">developmental roster</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_(WWE_brand)" title="NXT" target="_blank">NXT</a>, based in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Performance_Center" target="_blank" title="WWE Performance Center">WWE Performance Center</a> in <a title="Orlando, Florida" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. Overall, WWE is available in more than one billion homes worldwide in 30 languages. The company's <a title="Titan Towers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Towers" target="_blank">global headquarters</a> is located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford,_Connecticut" title="Titan Towers" target="_blank">Stamford, Connecticut</a>,<sup>[11]</sup> with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai, and Munich.<sup>[12]</sup>
            
            <br><br>As in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate contests but entertainment-based performance theater, featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_(professional_wrestling)" title="Wrestling storylines" target="_blank">storyline</a>-driven, scripted, and partially choreographed matches; however, matches often include moves that can put performers at risk of injury, even death, if not performed correctly. The pre-determined aspect of professional wrestling was publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner Vince McMahon in 1989 in order to avoid taxes from athletic commissions. WWE brands its product as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_entertainment" target="_blank" title="Sports Entertainment">sports entertainment</a>, acknowledging professional wrestling's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.
            
            <br><br>In 2023, WWE began to explore a potential sale of the company, amidst an employee misconduct scandal involving McMahon that had prompted him to step down as chairman and CEO, although he returned as executive chairman.<sup>[13]</sup> In April 2023, WWE made a deal with Endeavor Group Holdings, under which it would merge with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuffa" title="Zuffa" target="_blank">Zuffa</a>, the parent company of <a title="Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts">mixed martial arts</a> promotion <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship" title="UFC" target="_blank">Ultimate Fighting Championship</A> (UFC) to form TKO Group Holdings, a new <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company" title="Public Company">public company</a> majority-owned by Endeavor, with McMahon serving as executive chairman of the new entity, and Nick Khan becoming president. The merger was completed on September 12, 2023.<sup>[14]</sup></p>
